<div>
    If the build duration lasts longer than this percentage of (up to) the three most recent non-failing builds, 
    the build will be terminated and marked as aborted.  If there are no successful builds, this field is ignored.
    If both this field and the "Timeout in Minutes" are set, then the lowest of the two is used.
    No build will be terminated before 3 minutes.
